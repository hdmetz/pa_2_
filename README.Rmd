# load packages

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

# read and print csv file into Rstudio

data <- read_csv("data/data.csv")
print(data)

# Calculation of average of duration
avg_duration <- mean(data$durationV, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculation of average of f0
avg_f0 <- mean(data$f0, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculation of average of intensity
avg_intensity <- mean(data$int, na.rm = TRUE)

# Print the averages
cat("Average duration:", avg_duration, "\n")
cat("Average f0:", avg_f0, "\n")
cat("Average intensity:", avg_intensity, "\n")

#Averages all together: average duration was 0.154, average f0 was 99.992, and the average intensity was 59.591
